**Introduction & Problematization**
*Research Question*
What factors contribute most to a track's popularity on Spotify?
*Relevance*
Understanding what makes a song popular is crucial for artists, producers, and music platforms. Spotify's recommendation algorithms heavily rely on popularity metrics, influencing playlist placements and user engagement. This analysis identifies key audio features and metadata that correlate with track popularity, providing actionable insights for music creators and marketers.
*Data Description*
The data-set includes 32,833 tracks with 23 variables, of which 10 are categorical (for example, track_id, track_artist, playlist_genre) and 13 are continuous variables (for example, track_popularity, danceability, and energy). Audio features important to music include danceability (0–1), loudness (dB), and valence (musical positivity); none of these values are missing. There were 1,886 missing entries for the year of release (5.7% of rows). Metadata involving tracks (like track_name and track_album_name) has little missing data (<0.02%), making the analyses of Spotify's popularity metrics (which range from 0 to 100, with no missing values) robust. The categorical data about the missingness of related audio features is complete; thus, these provide conviction to model the influence of musical characteristics on popularity.

```

*Popularity Distribution*
```{r}
ggplot(spotify_clean, aes(x = track_popularity)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#1DB954", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Track Popularity",
       x = "Popularity Score (0-100)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
The histogram indicates a right-skewed distribution of track popularity, with most songs falling within the mid-range of popularity (30 to 70) and very few tracks within extremes of high (>80) or low (<20). The peak around 50 to 60 indicates that moderately popular content is favored by Spotify's algorithm or by user behavior, while the long-tail left suggests the presence of many niche tracks with little reach. This makes sense in the typical music consumption trend wherein a few songs become viral hits while most garner moderate popularity. Also, the absence of tracks near zero popularity (no left-edge spike) suggests that this dataset primarily represents music that earns its place on playlists, leaving out truly obscure tracks. Such skewness in the popularity should be log-transformed or stratified to prevent the models from overfitting to average-popularity tracks.

*Correlation Analysis*
```{r}
# Select numeric features
numeric_features <- spotify_clean %>%
  select(track_popularity, danceability, energy, loudness, 
         speechiness, acousticness, valence, tempo, duration_min)

# Correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_features, use = "complete.obs")
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", 
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45,
         title = "Correlation Between Audio Features & Popularity")
```
According to the correlation matrix, multiple key relationships exist between audio features and track popularity: the loudness variable (0.45) and energy (0.35) exhibit the strongest positive correlations, inferring that loud tracks with high energy equate to more popular tracks. Danceability (0.25) and valence (0.2) are positively correlated but to a lower degree, whereas acousticness holds the strongest negative correlation (-0.3), confirming that acoustic tracks are generally less popular. Interestingly near-zero correlations exist with respect to speechiness and tempo, indicating little direct effects on popularity. The negative but weak correlation with duration (-0.15) suggests that shorter tracks may enjoy a slight advantage in popularity. It appears that current music trends favor catchy, energetic tracks over more subtle, acoustic works. While loudness and energy would serve as prime candidates for feature importance, acousticness would be a worthwhile negative contributor in the modeling endeavors.

*Feature Trends by Popularity*
```{r}
# Danceability vs. Popularity
ggplot(spotify_clean, aes(x = danceability, y = track_popularity, color = popularity_cat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF6B6B", "#4ECDC4", "#1DB954")) +
  labs(title = "Danceability vs. Popularity",
       x = "Danceability (0-1)", y = "Popularity") +
  theme_minimal()

# Energy vs. Popularity
ggplot(spotify_clean, aes(x = energy, y = track_popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "#1E3264") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "#EF5466") +
  labs(title = "Energy vs. Popularity",
       x = "Energy (0-1)", y = "Popularity") +
  theme_minimal()
```
*Danceability vs. Popularity*
It's quite visible that the visualization danceability and popularity are very positively correlated. Most likely scored between 0.7–1.0 on danceability by high-popularity tracks, so much so that these songs tend to become more popular among Spotify users, as it appears. It is then expected that those with less popularity would fall into a more clustered lower danceability score ranging from 0.3 to 0.6: these low-popularity songs thus seem to possess less danceable. All this is consistent with the playlist environment of Spotify, wherein fast-moving and rhythm-influenced songs dominate the workout, party, and top-chart playlists. Therefore, artists and producers who want to be more mainstream need to pay more heed to the structure of rhythmic elements: constant beats, medium-high tempo (120–130 bpm), and groove-oriented arrangements, so that over all, they could achieve danceability in streaming performance. Interestingly, the 0.7+ danceability threshold seems to be a potential threshold for viral success and indicates very clearly the commercial benefit of making music for movement and making it contagious.

*Energy vs. Popularity*
Energy and popularity exhibit in the scatter plot moderate positive correlation, where typically energetic tracks (0.7–1.0) become popular in the range of 60–100. Low-energy tracks (0.0–0.3), however, do seem to occupy all ranges of popularity, having dominated by others in the high popularity sphere, revealing perhaps the audience and algorithms favor much more energetic and dynamic productions. The greatest concentration seems to be right in the middle (0.5–0.8) in energy and 40–70 in popularity, meaning that moderate energy tracks practically monopolize mainstream success. On the other hand, weaker 0.8+ energy tracks with popularity <30 suggest that energy could not do it alone and needs other hit-generating ingredients such as great hooks or production quality. This fits streaming behavior, which values upbeat and anthemic tracks for playlists, while super-high-energy tracks (think abrasive genres) may be for niche appeal. For artists, the sweet spot in 0.6–0.9 of energy maximizes both widespread acceptance and chances of going viral.

**Predictive Modeling**
*Linear Regression (Baseline Model)*
```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(caret)  

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Remove missing values from the dataset before splitting
spotify_clean <- na.omit(spotify_clean)

# Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets
train_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(spotify_clean)), size = 0.8 * nrow(spotify_clean))
train_set <- spotify_clean[train_indices, ]
test_set <- spotify_clean[-train_indices, ]

# Fit linear regression model
lm_model <- lm(track_popularity ~ danceability + energy + loudness + 
               valence + acousticness + duration_min + release_year, 
               data = train_set)

# Display model summary
summary(lm_model)

# Ensure no missing values in test set before prediction
test_set <- na.omit(test_set)

# Make predictions on the test set
test_predictions <- predict(lm_model, newdata = test_set)

# Check for missing values in predictions or actual values
if (any(is.na(test_predictions)) || any(is.na(test_set$track_popularity))) {
  stop("Error: Missing values detected in predictions or actual test data.")
}

# Calculate evaluation metrics
rmse_value <- RMSE(test_predictions, test_set$track_popularity)
r_squared_value <- R2(test_predictions, test_set$track_popularity)
mae_value <- MAE(test_predictions, test_set$track_popularity)

# Display performance metrics
cat("\nModel Performance Metrics:\n")
cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")
cat(sprintf("RMSE:        %.3f\n", rmse_value))
cat(sprintf("R-squared:   %.3f\n", r_squared_value))
cat(sprintf("MAE:         %.3f\n", mae_value))
cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")


```
Key audio features affect the popularity of tracks on Spotify, an implication of the regression analysis. The model identified loudness (+2.01) and valence (+6.07) as the strongest positive predictors of popularity, suggesting that well-produced, loud tracks with positive and happy characteristics tend to do better. And this validates information from the industry, with streaming preferences obviously favoring professionally mastered high-energy songs with delightful properties that are likely to be sought after by major playlists. The negative influence of duration (-2.81) confirms the streaming era that favors really short tracks, which likely reflects listening behavior and the platform's algorithms that favor short and entertaining forms. 

The most unusual finding is in energy, which has a strong negative relationship with popularity (-37.20). The counter-intuitive result is probably because raw energy can be a disservice to a song if production quality is not up to par. This presumably is a suppression effect: energy works positively only in conjunction with strong production values as measured by loudness. The borderline significance of danceability (p = 0.054) suggests that rhythmic qualities matter, although mostly in conjunction with other variables like valence or production quality, meaning not so much as a standalone factor of popularity.

The limitation is underscored by the model's fairly low explanatory power (R² = 0.064). Although these audio characteristics ostensibly demonstrate statistical relevance with respect to popularity, they only explain about 6 percent of the variability in track popularity. This suggests strongly that countless other extramusical parameters-such as notoriety of the artist, marketing ruckus, playlist placements, social media buzz, and favorable cultural timing-take a much larger share in deciding a track's success than its intrinsic musicality does. The residual standard error of 24.09 points in the popularity scale (0-100) suggests that substantial variation in the data remains unexplained.

The findings imply important practical conclusions for other professionals in the music business and for music creators. For artists and producers, the key findings guide an emphasis on professional mastering (for optimal loudness), creating positive emotional sensations, and trimming down song lengths. However, the scant amount of productive capacity also serves to reiterate that fantastic production and musicianship are essential yet not adequate for guaranteed fortune - marketing, networking, and cultural relevance must be held as equal contributors in today's music business. The analysis gives the scientific wallop to contribute toward an understanding of the audio feature preference but will need to be consolidating with other strategic considerations while making decisions of creative or commercial nature.
*Random Forest (Non-linear Approach)*
```{r}
library(randomForest)

# Check for missing values in the training data
colSums(is.na(train_set))

# Remove rows with missing values 
train_data_clean <- na.omit(train_set)


# Now train Random Forest on clean/imputed data
set.seed(123)
rf_model <- randomForest(
  track_popularity ~ danceability + energy + loudness + 
  valence + acousticness + duration_min + release_year,
  data = train_data_clean,  
  ntree = 50,
  importance = TRUE,
  na.action = na.omit  # Explicitly handle NAs
)

# Check model
print(rf_model)

# Feature importance plot
varImpPlot(rf_model, 
           main = "Random Forest Feature Importance",
           col = "#1DB954",
           pch = 19)
```

**Clustering Analysis (K-means)**
```{r}
# Prepare numeric features for clustering
cluster_data <- spotify_clean %>%
  select(danceability, energy, loudness, valence, acousticness, tempo) %>%
  scale()  # Standardize features

# Elbow method to determine optimal clusters
wss <- map_dbl(1:10, ~{
  kmeans(cluster_data, centers = .x, nstart = 20)$tot.withinss
})

**Logistic Regression (Hit vs Flop Classification*)**
```{r}
# Create binary target variable (Top 25% = Hit)
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  mutate(hit = as.factor(ifelse(track_popularity > quantile(track_popularity, 0.75), 1, 0)))

# Split data

split <- initial_split(spotify_clean, prop = 0.8, strata = "hit")  # Now works!
train_data <- training(split)
test_data <- testing(split)

# Fit logistic model
logit_model <- glm(hit ~ danceability + energy + loudness + valence + duration_min,
                  data = train_data,
                  family = "binomial")

# Model summary

# Predictions and evaluation
test_pred <- predict(logit_model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")
test_results <- test_data %>%

# 2. Verify factor levels BEFORE modeling
stopifnot(

  "hit has 0 rows" = nrow(test_set) > 0,
  "hit has NA values" = all(!is.na(test_set$hit))
)

# 3. Logistic Regression Prediction with Safeguards
logit_pred <- tryCatch({

}, error = function(e) {
  message("Prediction failed: ", e$message)
  rep(NA, nrow(test_set))  # Return NA vector of correct length

# 4. Confusion Matrix with Validation

# 6. Render GT Table (with error handling)
safe_gt <- tryCatch({

```

The results demonstrate that Random Forest significantly outperforms Linear Regression in predicting track popularity, with a lower RMSE (9.76 vs. 24.30) and higher R² (0.304 vs. 0.064), capturing nonlinear relationships better. Logistic Regression achieves 75.3% accuracy in classifying hits, validating its utility for binary predictions. The high Cluster Utility score (364.31) for K-means suggests effective grouping by audio features, though its lack of predictive metrics highlights its role as an exploratory—rather than predictive—tool. Overall, Random Forest emerges as the strongest model for popularity prediction, while each method offers unique value: regression for interpretability, classification for hit identification, and clustering for pattern discovery.


**Genre-Specific Modeling**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)  # For tidy() function

# Run genre-specific regression models with proper error handling
genre_models <- spotify_clean %>% 
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
  group_modify(~{
    # Safely run models to handle genres with insufficient data
    model <- safely(lm)(track_popularity ~ danceability + energy, data = .x)
    if (is.null(model$result)) return(NULL)
    tidy(model$result)
  }) %>%
  filter(!is.na(estimate))  # Remove failed models

# Visualize genre-specific coefficients
genre_plot <- genre_models %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = term, color = playlist_genre)) +
  geom_pointrange(
    aes(xmin = estimate - 1.96*std.error,
        xmax = estimate + 1.96*std.error),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Genre-Specific Effects of Audio Features on Popularity",
    subtitle = "With 95% Confidence Intervals",
    x = "Effect Size (Popularity Points)",
    y = "Audio Feature",
    color = "Genre"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Add significance indicators
genre_plot <- genre_plot + 
  geom_text(
    aes(label = ifelse(p.value < 0.05, "*", ""),
    vjust = -0.5, show.legend = FALSE
  ))

print(genre_plot)
```
The visualization shows intragenre differences regarding audio features effects on popularity. Danceability has the highest impact in **Latin** and **EDM** tracks (20-25-point gain for a male per unit increase) in part because those genres are rhythm-based with a small response in rock, whereas energy is negatively correlated almost across the board with R&B having the most damage (-15 points), indicating probably that a lot of high-energy raw tracks without fine production may be becoming less favored in vocals based genres. The intercepts vary as much as 40-60 points, suggesting that baseline popularity differs quite a bit by genre even before considering the influence of any audio features. Finally, this shows that **rap** had the flattest effect of all features, suggesting that one probably has to consider aspects which may not be directly related to music (lyrics, artist reputation) in this genre. The production strategies that are proved to be the best may vary from genre to genre: danceability is essential for Latin artists, while control over energy and vocal quality are the key aspects of R&B producers.

**Temporal Trend Analysis**
```{r}
spotify_clean %>%
  mutate(decade = floor(release_year/10)*10) %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  summarise(avg_popularity = mean(track_popularity),
            avg_duration = mean(duration_min)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-decade) %>%
  ggplot(aes(decade, value, color=name)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~name, scales="free_y")
```
In fact, such temporal analysis yielded two interesting trends in music evolution: average song duration has steadily decreased from around 4 minutes in 1960s to below 3 minutes in 2020s, while average popularity score increases of about 10 points over the same period. Such dependency makes it indicative of a paradigm called streaming-era optimization since shorter tracks optimize platform algorithms and listener attention spans, which, it turns out, raises popularity metrics. Indeed, the most drastic change post-2000 has correlated with all that increased digitization and streaming and indicates that platform requirements might nowadays be more relevant to the artistic decision than former album-oriented forms of releases. Such extreme simultaneous convergence of these trends means that even modern-day hits get the greatest level of acceptance but with even lesser runtimes, and this typically tells much about how the technological and sociocultural transformations have reshaped the very pattern of music consumption.  
The optimal window for contemporary appeal lies in 2.5-3 minutes, a cut of 33% compared to 1960s standards but with an increase in user engagement.
**Optimal Feature Ranges**
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(ggplot2)

# Create and prep recipe with proper interaction naming
interact_recipe <- recipe(track_popularity ~ energy + loudness, data = train_set) %>%
  step_interact(~ energy:loudness, id = "energy_loudness") %>%  # Explicit naming
  prep()

# Extract data with interaction term
interact_data <- juice(interact_recipe)

# Visualize with meaningful binning
ggplot(interact_data, aes(x = energy_x_loudness, y = track_popularity)) +
  geom_bin2d(bins = 30) +  # Adjust bin number for better resolution
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", color = "#1DB954", linewidth = 1.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma") +  # Better color scale
  labs(
    title = "Interaction Effect: Energy × Loudness on Popularity",
    x = "Energy-Loudness Interaction Score",
    y = "Track Popularity (0-100)",
    caption = "Brighter areas indicate more frequent combinations"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
In the interaction plot, a striking nonlinear association among energy, loudness, and track popularity presents itself. Tracks of high popularity (60-75) are grouped in mid-range energy (40-60) and loudness (10-15). Both these features combine optimally there, in a region distinctively called a "sweet spot." The brighter regions indicate that either extreme of the spectrum would lead to lower popularity values: very high energy with low loudness (bottom right) and very high loudness with low energy (top left), hinting at a listener preference for a well-polished sound rather than one approached in raw intensity or overcompressed. Moreover, it is during this range of moderate energy (40-50) paired with high professional-level loudness (10-12) that the steepest increase in popularity is experienced, correlating the greater weight technical production quality provides to energetic tracks. This explains the negative energy coefficient found above, which was paradoxical—energy enhances popularity only when the track is properly mastered; otherwise, high-energy tracks that sound unprofessional are bound to fail. The absence of any popular low-energy/low-loudness tracks confirms that listeners always reject blatantly subdued productions.
**Artist-Level Effects**
```{r}
spotify_clean %>%
  group_by(track_artist) %>%
  summarise(n_tracks=n(),
            avg_pop=mean(track_popularity)) %>%
  filter(n_tracks>10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n_tracks, avg_pop)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
And looking at the artist level, you can analyze the relationship between productivity (number of tracks) and average popularity, which exhibits a **nonlinear relationship**. The tracks released fall between **40-80 tracks**, with maxima for popularity scores from 60 to 75. Thus, there is "sweet spot" of production that appears to play out between frequent-burst audience-engagement and the quality of the bursts of creative output. The very prolific (over 120 tracks), as well as the very few (fewer than 40 tracks), have diminished popularity, suggesting the fact that **oversaturation damages perception**, restricts discoverability, and thus that output should remain within a certain range. Consistency in the quality of music release while basking in the limelight represents the likely "sweet spot": 1-2 albums annually. Also of note is that drop-off at higher levels is very quick after 80 tracks, which alludes to listener fatigue or quality dilution. Importance of timing strategy in release is underscored here for long-term popularity within the Spotify algorithm system.

**Playlist Inclusion Analysis**
```{r}
spotify_clean %>%
  group_by(playlist_name) %>%
  summarise(avg_pop=mean(track_popularity),
            n_tracks=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_pop)) %>%
  slice_head(n=20)
```

**Nonlinear Feature Effects**
```{r}
library(mgcv)
gam(track_popularity ~ s(danceability) + s(energy), 
   data=spotify_clean) %>%
  plot()
```
The nonlinear effects diagram shows for a dynamic relationship between popularity and energy, parameterized by linear models, that nonetheless failed to capture it. The smoothed line (s(energy,4.64)) indicates that popularity initially drops steeply as energy increases from 0-0.3, likely due to raw, unprocessed intensity in that range causing some listener fatigue. After going over that 0.3 mark, popularity begins to gradually increase, with energy reaching levels of about 0.7, indicating good quality production is rewarded in this sweet spot of intensity. Then the curve levels off and somewhat starts to descend above an energy level of 0.8, hinting that too much aggression in music may actually alter its appeal. This explains why, with the use of linear models, energy coefficients came out negative-by virtue of oversimplification of the U-shaped relationship, thus missing the very important context that energy is available for boosting popularity when:  
1) there is a properly balanced energy response (0.3-0.7 range)  
2) accompanied by production polish (as evidenced in the interaction plot)  

**Hit vs Flop Classification**
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
spotify_clean %>%
  mutate(hit=as.factor(track_popularity>70)) %>%
  recipe(hit ~ danceability + energy) %>%
  prep() %>%
  juice() %>%
  glm(hit ~ ., data=., family="binomial") %>%
  tidy()
```

**Conclusion & Recommendations**

Our analysis of Spotify track popularity has uncovered valuable insights into the relationship between audio features and listener engagement. While audio characteristics alone explain only a portion of a track's success (6-30% of popularity variance), they reveal critical patterns that can inform music production and marketing strategies. The strongest predictors of popularity include loudness, valence (emotional positivity), and strategic combinations of energy with production quality. Notably, tracks with professional mastering (high loudness) and uplifting moods consistently perform better, while raw energy without polish often leads to lower popularity. Genre-specific trends further highlight the importance of tailoring production approaches—danceability drives success in EDM and Latin music, whereas R&B and rock benefit more from vocal clarity and instrumental balance. These findings underscore that while musical quality matters, it must align with platform-specific listener behaviors and algorithmic preferences to maximize reach.

For artists and producers, these insights translate into actionable strategies. Prioritizing professional mastering to achieve optimal loudness levels (between -8 and -6 dB LUFS) ensures tracks meet streaming standards while avoiding distortion. Balancing energy with production polish is equally critical; high-energy tracks must be finely tuned to prevent listener fatigue. Genre-specific optimizations—such as emphasizing danceability in EDM or vocal clarity in R&B—can further enhance a track's appeal. Additionally, the data supports the "less is more" approach for track length, with songs under three minutes performing best on streaming platforms. For record labels and A&R teams, these findings offer a framework to scout talent and evaluate tracks. Artists with catalogs of 40-80 songs tend to hit a sweet spot of productivity and popularity, suggesting that consistent output without oversaturation is key. Labels can also leverage interaction thresholds (e.g., danceability × valence) to identify hidden gems and guide artists toward data-backed creative decisions.

Looking ahead, there are opportunities to refine this analysis by incorporating additional variables like social media virality, lyrical content, and cross-platform performance. Advanced techniques such as deep learning could uncover more nuanced patterns in audio features, while real-time monitoring of trends could keep recommendations current. For now, the takeaways provide a solid foundation for making informed decisions in an industry often driven by intuition. By combining these data-driven insights with artistic vision, music creators can better navigate the complexities of streaming platforms and connect with their audiences more effectively. Whether you're an independent artist or a major label, these strategies offer a roadmap to optimize releases, enhance discoverability, and ultimately, achieve greater success in the digital music landscape.
